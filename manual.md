1. Main Switches
2. Address Lights
3. Data Lights
4. Control Switches

While at first the panel may seem overwhelming, it will soon become second nature to use. 

As stated in the legend, the bottom row are address/data control switches. These are your main 
interface with the CPU and RAM. A line seperates them, showing you the Most Signifcant Byte on the left and the 
Least Signifigant Byte on the right.
