#Astro (I need a new name)

Astro should be a game about running a spaceship, powered by a small 
and weak CPU. I'm going for 0x10c but a couple decades back.

As of right now this repo is mostly for the AC-6 emulator I'm working
on, as well as the spec and guide in [manual.md](manual.md). The
CPU was originally 8-bit, although I'm just finishing up with making
it 12.

Goals include:

* Create and Debug programs using the CRIMP to toggle them in.
* Attach perpipherals like storage, printers, terminals, and more.
* Store spaceship control programs on Punch Cards/Tape Reels.
