#Astro (I need a new name)

Astro is a game about running a spaceship, powered by a small and weak CPU. Debug and repair programs by toggling in and reading opcodes and data values from the front panel, and write cool
programs on your CRT Terminal. Store spaceship control programs on Punch Cards and fly the ship with said programs.
